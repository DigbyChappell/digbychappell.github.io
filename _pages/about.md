I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Harvard Move Lab](https://www.movelab.seas.harvard.edu/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Conor Walsh](https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/conor-walsh). My research is focused on the application of functional electrical stimulation for ankle rehabilitation post-stroke.

Prior to joining Harvard, I was a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Nicolas Rojas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.rojas), [Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.kormushev), and [Prof. Fernando Bello](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/f.bello). My PhD focused on <i>Improving Myoelectric Prosthetic Hand Control via a Multifaceted, User-Centred Approach</i>, investigating user training, sensory feedback, and novel hand design, as well as developing next generation myoelectric controllers.

I received an MEng degree in Engineering from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in 2019, where my final year project investigated <i>Wearable Muscle Activity Sensors</i> under the supervision of [Prof. George Malliaras](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/gm603).

My research interests include all things **assistive and rehabilitative technology**. When I'm not in the lab, I'm usually playing badminton, othello, or making ice cream.

Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my research (or my icecream)!
