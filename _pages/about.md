I am a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I am supervised by [Dr. Nicolas Rojas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.rojas), and [Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.kormushev), and [Prof. Fernando Bello](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/f.bello). My research is focused on <i>improving the control of prosthetic hands from a holistic perspective</i>, investigating user training, sensory feedback, and novel hand design, as well as developing next generation myoelectric controllers.

Prior to joining Imperial College, I received an MEng degree in Engineering from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in 2019, where my final year project investigated <i>wearable muscle activity sensors</i> under the supervision of [Prof. George Malliaras](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/gm603).

My research interests include all things **prosthetics** and **robotics**, particularly **prosthetic hands**. When I'm not in the lab, I'm usually playing badminton, othello, or making ice cream.

Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my research (or my icecream)!
