**Update:** In January 2026 I will be joining [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) as an Associate Professor with a Tutorial Fellowship at [St Anne's College](https://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/). I'll be part of the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), where my lab will focus on Human Enhancing and Augmenting Techology.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Harvard Move Lab](https://www.movelab.seas.harvard.edu/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Conor Walsh](https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/conor-walsh) and [Prof. Lou Awad](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/louis-awad/). My research is focused on the application of functional electrical stimulation for ankle rehabilitation post-stroke.

Prior to joining Harvard, I completed my PhD at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Nicolas Rojas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.rojas), [Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.kormushev), and [Prof. Fernando Bello](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/f.bello). My PhD focused on <i>Improving Myoelectric Prosthetic Hand Control via a Multifaceted, User-Centred Approach</i>, investigating user training, sensory feedback, and novel hand design, as well as developing next generation myoelectric controllers.

I received an MEng degree in Engineering from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in 2019, where my final year project investigated <i>Wearable Muscle Activity Sensors</i> under the supervision of [Prof. George Malliaras](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/gm603).

My research interests include all things to do with **enhancing and augmenting human capabilities with technology**, with a focus on **assistive and rehabiliation technology** applications. When I'm not in the lab, I'm usually playing badminton, othello, or making ice cream.

Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my research (or my icecream)!
